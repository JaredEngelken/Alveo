I have posted the source code to 2 new Alveo Custom Indicators at https://github.com/dbaechtel/Alveo/tree/master/Indicators.

The source code for the indicators are a good study of how to write good Indicator code for Alveo.

EMA3 - a 3 color version of the Alveo EMA indicator.

HEMA - the Honest EMA indicator that uses the Hull Moving Average equation, substituting EMAs for the WMA functions.

Let me know what you think of them.
